# Tour de Lake View

On July 5th, 2025 the prestigeous Tour de France will kick off in Lille and wind 2,063 miles to a finish at the Champs-Élysées in Paris. On July 13th, I will attempt to traverse every street in Lake View, Chicago in what will be known as the Tour de Lake View. This project is about the challenge of finding the optimal route for said traveral.
